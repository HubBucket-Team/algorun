# Algorun

Algorun aims at defining a standard container to turn a command-line application into a ready-to-use web application.

## The problem : science reproducability in computational sciences sucks

Science reproducibility is a big deal. If it is understandable that science reproducibility is hard to achieve in non-computational fields, it should be a no-brainer in all computational fields. Yet, it is most of the time still a non-trivial task to reproduce somebody else's results in computational sciences. We can do better in 2015.

## Algorun : providing a standard for science reproducability in computational sciences

Algorun's goal is to enable scientists to turn any command-line application into a ready-to-use web application. Algorun relies heavily on Docker (http://github.com/docker). It basically wraps up and containerize a command line applications to make it easily distributable and usable through a nice web interface and a standard web API.
